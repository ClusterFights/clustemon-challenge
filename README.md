It\'s like Pokem√≥n!

There is a referee server that all the clusters connect to. Each cluster
can get a list of all the other clusters and their health. Attacks are
performed by specifying the target cluster to the referee and receiving
a hash. Reversing the hash successfully and sending the answer to the
server will remove the hit points from the target. The clusters can also
request a health boost from the referee server by solving similar
hashes. There will also be a \"golden egg\" hash which is just really
hard to solve. First one to get it automatically wins.
